# modal-editing

My journey with modal editing started when I had to use vim in sco unix (year was 1998 maybe) to configure some ip-addresses to different server around a factory.
I did not understand it at all . I had to keep key-reference cheatsheet with me at all time to do those changes every now and then.

Later on I head about neovim and how it is really fast and great way to edit code. I tried few distros and since I also use in windows, those gave me errors, etc.. 
I started using vim motions in Visual Studio and VScode.. those are nice and repeatable, it needs tweaking amd I felt that i could do better. There is so many things to learn and 
somehow the usage was not spot on either.. maybe it could be with enough configuration .. and I also need to change the way I do things..

Eventually I tried to understand neovim better and watched this great video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM&t=1808s
Also I could not avoid seeng theprimeagen and watched few videos.. this was the main thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE

I came around my way to making the config and that is what I will be sharing here ... Currently the config works nicely on windows and linux. Using neovim-qt on windows.
TODO:
- add Mason
- add LSP

  At this stage I found Helix editor that seems more intuitive to me. Not totally decided yet, but it was easy to setup and has tons of functionality ..and sharing that setup here too.
